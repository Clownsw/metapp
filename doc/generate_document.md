# How to generate documentations

All documentations are generated from the source code in folder `metapp/tests/docsrc`. The document .md file name is same to the .cpp source file name.  

The documentations are generated by running the command  
```
cd metapp/tools
python gendoc.py 
```
The tool requires Python 3

In folder `metapp/tests/docsrc`, all files that name starts with "doc_" are the documentation source files. There are different source file types.  
For .cpp file, the comment and code in the file are parsed and converted to .md file.  
For .md file, it's copied to the doc folder.  
Note: the "doc_" file name prefix are removed from the generated documentation files.  

So, to modify the documentation, DON'T modify the files in doc folder. You should modify the files in docsrc folder and run the tool the generate the documentations.
