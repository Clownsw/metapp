# Built-in meta types overview

metapp supports a large amount of ready to use built-in meta types, from fundamental types such as `int` or `double`
to STL containers such as `std::vector` or `std::map`, etc.  

## How to use the build-in meta types

To use the built-in meta types, the below header must be included.

```c++
#include "metapp/allmetatypes.h"
```

The header includes all built-in meta types. You don't need include separate headers of each meta types.
And even if you only need one meta type, you should still include `allmetatypes.h`, because it can handle pointer, reference,
and other cases.  

## List of meta types

In this section, only a few meta types are detailed documented, since most meta types are straightforward and easy to understand.  
To see the basic information, please see [List of all built-in meta types](list_all.md)
