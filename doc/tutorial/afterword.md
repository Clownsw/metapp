# Afterword of the tutorials

## How to generate the tutorials

All tutorials are generated from the tutorial code in folder `metapp/tests/tutorial`. The document .md file name is same to the .cpp source file name.  

The tutorials are generated by running the command  
```
cd metapp/doc
sh gentutorials.sh
```
The tool requires Python 3

## How to modify the tutorials

Since the tutorials are generated automatically, we should never modify the .md files directly. To modify the tutorials, we should modify the tutorial C++ source code, then run the tool to generate the documentations.
